# 🧮 Calculator App

A browser-based calculator built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Practice manipulating the DOM, handling user input, and implementing basic arithmetic logic.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Basic Operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- **Decimal Support** for floating‑point calculations  
- **Clear & Delete** functionality (clear all or backspace last entry)  
- **Keyboard & Button Input**: click buttons or use keyboard keys  
- **Responsive Layout**: adapts to various screen sizes  
- **Error Handling**: prevents invalid input (e.g., multiple decimals)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Capturing and processing **click** and **keyboard** events  
- Managing **calculator state** (current operand, previous operand, operation)  
- Updating the **display** dynamically based on user actions  
- Handling **edge cases** (division by zero, chaining operations)  
- Structuring code for **separation of concerns** between UI and logic

## 📚 Assignment Summary
This project was part of The Odin Project’s Foundations curriculum. The objectives were to:
1. Build a functional calculator UI with HTML & CSS.  
2. Use JavaScript to:
   - Capture button clicks and key presses  
   - Store and update operands and the selected operation  
   - Perform calculations and update the display  
3. Implement clear-all, delete-last, and decimal point handling.  
4. Ensure a clean, user‑friendly interface and responsive design.
